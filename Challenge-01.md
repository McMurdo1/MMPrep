Part 1
======
Watch “Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals” at Lynda.com and then answer
the following questions:

1. Imagine asking a friend to meet you at a restaurant. What instructions would 
   a computer program need that your friend would not in order to understand how
   to get there?
   
The computer needs the instructions be very specific and broken down into small parts. You could tell a friend "Go about a mile", but a computer needs the exact distance. You could also tell a friend "Meet me at the restaurant. Take the interstate. You'll get there faster." That implies a lot of assumptions about the friend: they will be driving, they know how to drive, they know what interstate you mean. For a computer, each of those steps must be brokwn down. "Get in the car. Put the key in the ignition. Start the car. etc"

2. What is the difference between source code and machine code? What does the
   CPU do? Where are instructions and data stored?
   
Machine code is the language the computer actually understands. It is made of complex sets of characters humans can't understand. Source code is what a programmer actually types in when creating a program. This is then translated into machine code for the computer to run. The CPU is the brains of the computer, directing its component parts and telling them what to do. The instructions and data are stored in the machine's memory or disk. 

3. What is an IDE and why is it useful?

An IDE is short for integrated development environment. They are programs used to help developers write code. They often have shortcuts and improvements which can save time coding. For example, they might automatically change the color on certain key words to help the developer read the code he wrote. 

4. What kind of a language is Objective-C? Why do you think we use it for making
   device specific applications? Why wouldn't we want to use an interpreted
   language for making iPhone and iPad apps?
   
Objective-C is a compiled language. It is useful for making device specific applications because you know the type of hardware the device is going to be running on. This allows applications to run faster. Using an interpreted language for iPhone and iPad apps would be a waste of hardware resources and battery life since the apps would only ever run on those devices anyway.
